## <b> Summary: </b><br>
This project is about creating a simplified 3D graphic representation of a relief landscape.

## <b> Introduction: </b><br>
The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. For example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a prerequisite condition to its conquest. As another example, comparing various 3D repre- sentations of an area of high tectonic activity will allow you to better understand these phenomenon and their evolution, and as a result be better prepared. <p>

Itâ€™s your turn today to modelize in 3D some magnificent landscapes, imaginary or not...

## <b> General Considerations: </b><br>
- The first project of Codam (42 Network School) in the graphic branch, the full PDF can be found in this repository. <br>
- Group project (two persons).
- Makefile commands: 
```
make
make re
make clean
make fclean
```
- Usage: 
```
./fdf [ test_maps/mapfile.fdf ]
```

###### <b> Test maps provided in this repository: </b><br>

- Controls: 
```
Move with arrows (UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT).
Change hight using + and -.
Zoon in: I
Zoon out: O.
Four sets of colors, change with the following keys:
B = Blue.
P = Pink.
R = Red.
Y = Yellow.
```
