## <b> Summary: </b><br>
This project is about creating a simplified 3D graphic representation of a relief landscape.

## <b> Introduction: </b><br>
The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. For example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a prerequisite condition to its conquest. As another example, comparing various 3D representations of an area of high tectonic activity will allow you to better understand these phenomenon and their evolution, and as a result be better prepared. <p>

Itâ€™s your turn today to modelize in 3D some magnificent landscapes, imaginary or not...

## <b> General Considerations: </b><br>
- The first project of Codam (42 Network School) in the graphic branch, the full PDF can be found in this repository. <br>
- Group project (two persons).
- Makefile commands: 
```
make
make re
make clean
make fclean
```
- Usage: 
```
./fdf [ test_maps/mapfile.fdf ]
```

###### <b> Test maps provided in this repository. </b><br>

<b>Controls: </b>
> Move with arrows (UP, DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT). <br>
> Change hight using + and -.<br>
> Zoon in: I<br>
> Zoon out: O.<p>
> ESC to quit the program.<p>
> <b>Four sets of colors, change with the following keys:</b><br>
> B = Blue.<br>
> P = Pink.<br>
> R = Red.<br>
> Y = Yellow.<br>
